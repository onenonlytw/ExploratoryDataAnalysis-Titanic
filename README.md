# 🛳️ Titanic EDA Project

## 📌 Overview
This project is a mini data analysis exercise using the famous **Titanic dataset**. It was completed as part of the **Faculty of Data – Digital Skill Fair 38** program by [@dibimbing.id](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dibimbingid/).

The goal of this project is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns and insights that affected passenger survival during the Titanic disaster.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To explore and understand the Titanic dataset.
- To perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- To visualize key patterns in the data.
- To generate meaningful insights about survival factors.

## 📊 Key Insights
- Most passengers were adults.
- Male passengers were more frequent than female passengers.
- More passengers survived (270) than did not (230).
- Gender had a strong influence on survival chances, with females having a higher survival rate.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
